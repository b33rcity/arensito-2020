# Arensito-2020

This is a modified version of the layout created by HÃ¥kon Hallingstad in 2001. The original 
is hosted at http://pvv.org/~hakonhal/main.cgi/keyboard/. 

## The Original

In my quest for a new layout I found that many are quite old and have lost their hosting. 
As a just in case measure, here is the original layout:

Main layer
```
      q  l  ,  p           f  u  d  k
      a  r  e  n  b     g  s  i  t  o
      z  w  .  h  j     v  c  y  m  x
```

Shift layer
```
      Q  L     P           F  U  D  K
      A  R  E  N  B     G  S  I  T  O
      Z  W  !  H  J     V  C  Y  M  X
```

AltGr layer
```
      {  }  [  ]           _  <  >  $
      ;  /  -  0  :     \  1  (  )  =
      6  7  8  9  +     *  2  3  4  5
```

## The Mods

The main difference stems from my opinion on whether it is better to curl or extend the outter fingers.
The letters with lower frequency but on the bottom row are swapped with their upper row counterparts.
V and D are also swapped to eliminate same finger home row jumps in  words like "admin"--but this will 
likely change as the "ds" digraph is annoyingly common.

Additionally, the right top row of the kinesis implementation has (redundant) enclosure symbols to 
facilitate coding. AltGr is replaced by the Advatage 2's keypad-shift key, and a couple letters I 
wanted in the top layer use up the extra keys. (Really, this layout demands a keyboard like the 
Advantage2, Dactyl Manuform, or, at a minimum, Ergodox.)

In the ANSI 101 implementation, the lack of the AltGr key (standard on ISO 104) and my reliance on having
a right_alt key prompted the addition of atop row based on the Programmer's Dvorak layout, with enclosure 
characters and $ rearranged for the benefit of shell (and incidentally Perl) programmers.
